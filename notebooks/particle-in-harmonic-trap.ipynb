    "However, both choices are not optimal since in real space the position operator is diagonal while the momentum operator is a completely dense matrix and vice versa for the momentum space. Therefore, the calculation will scale with $N^2$ where $N$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space. A commonly used trick is to utilize fast Fourier transformation to convert the state of the system between real and momentum space. This allows us to always use the diagonal form of the operators which all in all speeds up the calculations to $N \\log N$.\n",
